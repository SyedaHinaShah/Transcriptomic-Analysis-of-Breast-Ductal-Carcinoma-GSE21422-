# Transcriptomic-Analysis-of-Breast-Ductal-Carcinoma-GSE21422-
This repository provides an open-source transcriptomic analysis workflow of the GEO dataset GSE21422, profiling ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Using R and Bioconductor, the project covers data preprocessing, normalization, differential gene expression (limma), and visualization (volcano plot)
